# Menu Builder Extended

In addition to the base requirements of [Menu Builder](//github.com/code-builders/curriculum/blob/master/rails/projects/menu-builder.md) add the following using javascript:

- Add a close link to all error messages. It should be a link with a click event to hide the error messages on the page.
- Add a toggle link next to each menu section title on the homepage. When clicking the link the following should happen:
  - The items for the section are hidden.
  - The text of the hide link changes to indicate that the items are hidden
  - When clicking the link again, the items are shown and the text is reverted to it's original state.
