# CitySca.pe

We are going to use the [Twitter Search API](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/search) to create a system to analyze a city (starting with Seattle) via social media alone. We will be beginning with broad ideas and moving on to more specific analysis over time. The app will determine the following using social media:

- Weather within the last 24 hours
- Current time of day
- Current Traffic status
- Are people happy?
- Moving/Visiting Seattle

The application will have a homepage which displays this data in a visually interesting way.
