# Letter Swapper

Make a method which swaps each pair of letters in a word. So letters 1 & 2 switch places, 3 & 4, 5 & 6, etc...

If the last letter in the word doesn't have a pair (if it's next to a space or end of the sentence) do nothing

```rb
swap("Pineapple") # => "iPenpalpe"
swap("Hello there") # => "eHllo htree"
```
