# Character count

Create a method which checks if all of the letters in a word have the exact same number of occurrences. The method should return `true` or `false`.

For example:

- "abcabc" is a valid word because 'a' appears twice, 'b' appears twice, and'c' appears twice.
- "abcabcd" is NOT a valid word because 'a' appears twice, 'b' appears twice, 'c' appears twice, but 'd' only appears once!
- "123abc!" is a valid word because all of the characters only appear once in the word.
