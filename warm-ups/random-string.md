# Random String

Create a class called `RandomString`, create the following class methods:

- `.generate(n)` - Returns a string of `n` length of random characters made up of any of the following characters `a-zA-Z0-9!@#$%^&*()<>?:{}|`
- `.url_safe(n)` - Returns a string of `n` length of random characters made up of any of the following characters `a-zA-z0-9-`

Extended Requirements
----------

Recreate the previous methods but use the current time in the calculation so that the same string will never be generated twice (unless it happened on the same second).
