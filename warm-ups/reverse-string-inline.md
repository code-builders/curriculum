# Reverse a String in place

In CS the idea of an "in place" algorithm means that no additional (or very little) memory is needed. Typically when we have been doing any type of algorithm we create a `new_array` or `new_string` variable which we put the result in, an in place algorithm does not use an additional string or array. So, without creating any new strings or arrays, create a method which reverses the characters in a string.

Use pen, paper, whiteboard, etc... to write out the logic using pseudo-code and diagrams before beginning coding.
