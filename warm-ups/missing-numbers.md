# Missing Numbers

Create a method which finds the missing numbers in a sorted list. For example:

```rb
missing_numbers([1,2,5,6,7,9]) # => [3,4,8]
```

The method should only return numbers within the range of the lowest and highest numbers, but return a new array which includes the number missing from that range.
