Make a bare bones Rails app which will be used to rate coffee. Make the Rails app with the following:

- No `TestUnit`
- A `postgresql` db
- A `CoffeeController` with an `index` method
- The root route goes to `CoffeeController` `index`
- A `coffees/index.html.erb` with a simple greeting
- A `Coffee` model with `name`, `origin`, and `roast` (all strings).

Note: We'll be using this app for future lectures.
