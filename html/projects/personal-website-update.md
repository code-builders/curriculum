## Personal Website

This week you will continue the creation of a personal website used to promote yourself as a developer. Your site should have at least two distinct sections (can be separate pages or not). Design your site to the best of your ability, if you don't consider yourself a great artistic designer, find a group of sites that you really like and let some of their designs guide yours.

Focus on defining a goal and creating a design and user experience that you feel will best help attain that goal.

You can modify your previous personal site or start fresh. The site can be static HTML, a rails app, or something new such as [Sinatra (ruby)](http://www.sinatrarb.com), [Flask (python)](http://flask.pocoo.org), or [Express (js backend)](http://expressjs.com) (I can help you with any of those if you go down a new route). Decide on the functionality that you want, then pick the best fitting structure. For example, if you want to integrate a custom contact form which sends you an email, you won't want to do a static site.
