>Have an idea quota; write ideas down

>Now comes the action.

>Every day, set out an idea quota within a period of roughly 45 minutes to an hour, where you do nothing but write down ideas about the area that you have chosen. If it’s a local business idea, then write 50 ideas on local businesses within that time frame. Don’t worry about how bad the ideas seem. Just write them down.

>Try to be as religious as you can with this. And do it for about 10 days.


## Prototype

This week is about widdling down (or getting) ideas and thinking through some general questions. Take time to get up to 3 different ideas, start thinking of answers to the following questions:

- What does it do?
- Who is the target audience?
- Who are the competitors (and what makes your different?)
- What technologies do you already know that you'll use?
- What technologies do you now know that you'll use?
- Are there any ideas which you are unsure what technologies to use?
